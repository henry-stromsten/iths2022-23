Deliverables and work in progress.
This repository aims to be the center hub for all deliverables and work in progress for me as a student at IT-HÃ¶gskolan (iths) in Gothenburg, Sweden. My goal with studying this course at iths is to learn about automation in software testing; when and where it is useful and when it enhances our knowledge about the software tested amd its quality.
